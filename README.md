Type renaming (refactoring) is already a feature in the official C/C++ extension. However, header **file** renaming with automatically updating references is not.

This extension lets you rename a C++ header, automatically updates all references to it (in project files), updates header guards and renames the corresponding .cpp file (if any).

Enjoy! GitHub PRs and issues are welcome!
